**Objects**
Basics: Objects literal shorthands make testing more intuitive than it was previously. Just ask yourself, what am I expecting to see?
Computed Properties: This was a lot more obtuse to me, but essentially make sure you have all your parentheses/brackets accounted for and object literals can be computed values.

**Classes**
Creation: Simple to declare classes (class XXX {}). I remember talking about constructor method in foundations, there can only be one in each class 
Statics: Define something within a class that doesn't need to be replicated throughout.
Extends: Classes can inherit traits from other classes using extends.

**Destructuring**
Array Destructuring: Destructuring is like refactoring but on a smaller level.
String Destructuring: I feel like destructuring must make arrays of strings a lot easier to deal with.
Object Destructuring: Another 'keep your brackets sorted' deal, but left hand variable needs {} and works with multiple objects.
Destructuring with Defaults: Default values can be used for undefined or missing values, or within an object.
Destructuring Function Parameters: Makes parameters simpler and easier to read, one can assign default values to different parameters or for a missing value.
Destructuring with Alias: Combine default values and destructuring all in the same line of code!

**Rest**
Rest as a Parameter: Rest would have been so helpful during foundations code challenges, it limits redundancies and allows you to grab multiple params easily.
Rest while Destructuring: Rest is pretty intuitive as long as you follow the "rules". 

**Spread**
Array Spread: Almost opposite to rest, spread can go anywhere and expands items in an array.

**Function Defaults**
Function Defaults: If a function has no value or is undefined, deault parameters may be set.
